# BANK_CREDIT_-SYSTEM
This project implements a state-of-the-art Credit Risk Scorecard system using machine learning to revolutionize loan approval decisions for banks and financial institutions. The system predicts loan default probability with 94.15% ROC-AUC accuracy, implements intelligent risk-based pricing, and optimizes portfolio profitability.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:

1.Model Performance

🏆 ROC-AUC Score: 0.9415 (Exceptional discrimination)
🎯 Precision: 96.34% (Minimal false alarms)
⚡ Recall: 71.43% (Catches most defaults)
🛡️ Specificity: 99.26% (Protects good borrowers)

2. Business Impact

💰 Portfolio Optimization: Intelligent 30% acceptance rate strategy
📊 Risk Segmentation: 5-tier classification system
💳 Dynamic Pricing: 4 different interest rate strategies
📈 Profit Maximization: Data-driven portfolio composition

3.Technical Excellence

🔄 Ensemble Methods: Random Forest + Gradient Boosting + Logistic Regression
⚖️ Model Calibration: Sigmoid calibration for accurate probabilities
🔨 Feature Engineering: 28 features (7 original + 14 one-hot + 7 engineered)
📊 Comprehensive Analysis: EDA, feature importance, sensitivity analysis

💡 Key Business Insights

🎯 Excellent Calibration: Predicted vs actual default rates align perfectly
💰 Profit Concentration: Only "Very Low Risk" segment generates profit (+$1.89M)
⚠️ High Risk Warning: "Very High Risk" segment causes massive losses (-$6.61M)
📈 Portfolio Strategy: Focus on very low and low-risk segments for profitability
